I AM
It is important that you know who you are. You are more than the name that was given to you. We want to know what it is that makes you, you! There is much power behind the I am statement. Think of the three best attributes that best describe who you are.

Understanding The WHY Factor
“Whatever you want, go ALL IN and DOMINATE, learn it, eat it, sleep it, breathe it and believe it”
- Grant Cardone

Why are you here? Is it money? Is it a fresh start? Does the idea of being your own boss motivate you? Maybe you have dreams of traveling the world. Bottom line, you need to understand your WHY. Making money by itself, is not the WHY. The real question is, what are you going to do with the money you earn? That is your real motivation.

Commitment
GO ALL IN
What do you bring to the table that is unique? What commitment are you going to make for yourself and Equity Adjusters? Decide now, what are three things you are going to commit to that will benefit yourself as well as your team?

Combining your WHO, WHY, COMMIT
Now that you have your three attributes, motivating factors, and commitments, you are ready to create your statements. The first statement will be your WHO statement. Example: I AM an intelligent, diligent, and caring member of team Equity Adjusters!

Assignment 1
Fill out each section and use the data from the questions to create your I am statement and your commitment statement.`

    pages: "Pages 3-7",
    content: `Vision Statement
“He who says he can, and he who says he can’t, are both usually right”

A vision statement should be a paragraph or two that describes your targets in your personal life, business/company, and financial situation over the next year. It is something that you can read daily to remind yourself what you are going to accomplish over the next twelve months. Think BIG! If your goals don’t motivate you than they are not big enough.

Vision Statement Areas
Personal: How do you want your life to look? How do you want your health to be? What places do you want to go? Where will you live? What will you drive? How will others see you?

Business/Company: What will your position be? How will you grow Equity Adjusters? What market will you be working? Who will be on your team? What can you bring to the table that others cannot? How much revenue do you intend to bring? How big do you want to grow this company?

Financial: How much will you earn? Do you want to be debt free? Will you have residual income? What will you do with the money you want to earn?

Develop Habits
Developing habits are what shape the kind of life you want. It is important to focus on the end result and what you want in the long term, but it is what you do every SINGLE day that matters more than anything.`

WE ARE IN A RECESSION PROOF INDUSTRY
People will always have to protect their investments with insurance, and catastrophic events are continuing to become more frequent.

GENERAL TERMS
Insurer: Insurance Company providing insurance for the insured.
Insured: The individual or business who has insurance.
Policy Holder: Individual or business that has ownership of the insurance policy.
Premium: The cost of insurance the policy holder pays to keep insurance effective.
Deductible: In the event of an insurance claim, most policies require the insured to pay a deductible AKA Co-Pay on a per claim basis.
Loss Peril: A specific risk that is covered under the terms of the insurance policy.
Scope of work: The work that is to be carried out under a contract to complete a project.
Depreciation: Decrease in value due to wear and tear, age, decline in price, decay, etc.
Dwelling: Livable space. House, apartment, garage, etc.
Benefit: Insurance benefits are the payments your insurance provider guarantees to make after covered services under an insurance policy.
Exclusion: A loss risk that is not covered under an insurance policy.

WHAT IS AN INSURANCE CLAIMS ADJUSTER?
There are three types of insurance adjusters: Staff Adjusters, Independent Adjusters, and Public Adjusters. A Public adjuster is hired by the policy holder to legally represent the policy holder to maximize the insurance claim and protect the interests of the insured.

HOW IS AN INSURANCE CLAIM PAID OUT?
Claims are typically broken up into two payments: Actual Cash Value (ACV) and Replacement Cost Value (RCV). Recoverable depreciation may be paid after the insured completes the repairs and provides proof such as an invoice and photos.`

    content: `IDENTIFYING STORM DAMAGE
HAIL DAMAGE
Hail can damage roofing, soft metals, siding, paint, air conditioning units, storage sheds, windows, window screens, gutters, solar panels, stucco, personal property, and essentially any exposed property.

SPOTTING HAIL DAMAGE
When prospecting a neighborhood, it is important to know and understand which direction specific storms come from and hit. Once you know what direction a storm hits, you can look for signs of damage such as dents in the garage door, dents on gutters, paint chipping, air conditioning coils, etc.

Test Square
Test squares are used to determine if a roofing system deserves to be replaced due to hail damage. To qualify for a roof replacement, typically you need 5+ hail strikes in a 10 ft x 10 ft square area on each slope for insurance to approve.

WIND DAMAGE TO ROOFING
With most violent storms, damaging wind is always a factor. The more obvious signs are blown shingles, tiles, or uplifted metal. The less obvious signs are shingle creasing and tile cracking.

INTERIOR DAMAGE (ROOF LEAKS)
Roof leaks are common, especially with older roofs. Insurance may deny interior leaks if it has been an ongoing problem for a long time. The leak must be sudden and a direct result from an issue with the roof.`

    content: `THE CLAIMS PROCESS
1. Meet - A certified Equity Adjusters representative meets with the property owner, reviews the insurance policy, and gets all paperwork completed.
2. Initial Prequalifying Inspection - A certified inspector documents damage and creates a forensic report.
3. File Claim/Schedule Insurance Inspection - The claim is filed and insurance assigns an adjuster.
4. Insurance Inspection - The licensed public adjuster meets with the insurance company on the property.
5. Negotiations/Estimate Review - The estimate is reviewed and negotiated until common ground is met.
6. Meet with Policy Holder - The ACV check is reviewed and repair options are discussed.
7. Construction - Equity Adjusters contractor completes the construction work.
8. Final invoicing/close file - Insurance is invoiced and the RCV is processed.

APPRAISAL PROCESS
If the public adjuster and insurance adjuster cannot agree on a claim, the claim may go to appraisal. Both sides hire third-party appraisers. If the appraisers cannot agree, an umpire may make the final decision.`

    content: `Storm Restoration Sales
You need to be SOLD on selling. The most important sale you will ever make is to yourself. When you fully believe in the value Equity Adjusters brings to property owners, and you are convinced that sales is for you, only then will you achieve.

Why choose storm restoration sales?
We bring people MONEY. We do not charge clients directly for our services. The more money we win for the property owner, the more you make. There is no cap on your income.

Door to Door Sales
Cold calling, canvassing, and door knocking are some of the most effective ways to generate business. Common myths are that everyone will be rude, nobody will listen, and nobody likes door to door salespeople. In reality, many people are nice and will listen.

NUMBER ONE RULE OF SELLING
Always, always, ALWAYS agree with the customer. Any objection or response from a prospect should first be met with agreement and understanding.

SALES CYCLE
Pre-opener, Intro/Greeting, Fact Finding/Qualifying, Presentation, Close, Referral.

FOLLOW UP
Follow up is the single most important skill you must develop. Most people need multiple contacts before making a decision. Use text messages, personal visits, phone calls, video calls, email, and written letters.

COLD CALLING GUIDELINES
Be honest, transparent, straight forward, interesting, interested, logical, structured, respectful, enthusiastic, positive, memorable, entertaining, and always smile.`
